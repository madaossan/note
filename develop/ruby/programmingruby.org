* Facets of Ruby
** Ruby.new
*** Ruby is an Object-Oriented Language
*** Some Basic Ruby
*** Arrays and Hashes
*** Symbols
Symbols are simply constant names that you don't have to predeclare and that are guaranteed to be unique. A symbol literal starts with a colon and is normally followed by some kind of name:
walk(:north)
Symbols are frequently used as keys in hashes. Ruby has a shortcut syntax: you can use name: value pairs to create a hash if the keys are symbols.
inst_section= {
	cello: 'string'
}
*** Control Structures
