** Android Lifecycle
The class android.Activity provides a number of well-defined life-cycle methods that are called when an application is started, suspended, restarted, etc., as well as a method you can call to mark an Activity as finished.
An Android application has three states it can be in:
Active: the app is visible to the user and is running;
Paused: the app is partly obscured and has lost the input focus.
Stopped - the app is completely hidden from view
void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
